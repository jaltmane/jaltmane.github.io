He is a freelance musician & educator, composer, substitute teacher, army musician, and technology enthusiast. Jonathan also enjoys creating short films, painting, reorganizing, DIY home rennovation, and building things with power tools!

Jonathan received education through the NYC public school system (PS6, Wagner, Talent Unlimited HS). While in High School he studied Tuba, Music Theory, and Ear Training at the Manhattan School of Music. He enrolled in the Eastman School of Music and left after one year of study. Upon returning to NYC he enrolled in Hunter College for a semester and studied painting before transferring to Queens College, CUNY where he completed his BA in Music in 2015.

Jonathan currently maintains a piano studio of approximately 15-20 students. He also teaches guitar and voice. Most recently he developed an online system for distributing his students lesson materials and notes when the COVID-19 Pandemic made in person teaching unreliable.  

Nothing is more enjoyable to him than seeing other peoples growth. During the day he is a substitute with the NYCDOE. He believes in climate activism, social justice, and economic liberalization. He frequently wonders how the digital world can make things more equitable. Although he has received formal education Jonathan considers himself an autodidact. 

He is a fan of all things regarding technology, physics, music, and the universe.
